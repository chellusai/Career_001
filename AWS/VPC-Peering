vpc peering :

The main purpose of vpc peering is to communicate with different networks..

Senario :

application team ==>> 30.20.0.0/16

admin team ==>> 60.20.0.0/16

By making peering between these two teams ==>> files trasfter and remote userly application will install..

VPC peering thumbrule :

Both vpc's CIDR notations should not be collide to each other.

VPC peering not supported transitive peering.

vpc1 ==>>> vpc2 ==>> vpc3 ==>> vpc4

vpc1 should not communicate with vpc3

vpc2 should not communicate with vpc4.

VPC peering ==>> who is the requester and accepter ===>> we will specify..

key point : Both VPC CIDR notations are interchanged in both main routing tables..

Then these two vpc's in between  ==>>> vpc peering connection established.

VPC peering will be doing in 3 ways..

1. same region.

2. different region.

3. different accounts / cross accounts..
