Transite gateway :

The main purpose of Transite gateway is to communicate with different networks.

Transite gateway thumb rule :

Both vpc's CIDR notations should not be collide to each other.

Transitegateway supports transtive peering..

vpc1 ==>> vpc2 ==> vpc3 ==>> vpc4

create transitegatway ==>> when ever you created TGW ==>>> then automatically transitgateway routing tables will create.

next we will TGWattachments for every vpc (infrastructure)

key point : ALL VPC CIDR notations are interchanged in ALL main routing tables..
